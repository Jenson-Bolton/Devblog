# My Devblog

Welcome to my devblog page. Here I will be posting updates about ongoing project, my views on current technologies and, other random updates. I hope to build my own video game, the details of which should be in my first post.

## Git Structure

This repository will be uploaded to the web server and is split into the three following categories:

### Website

The website will be constructed using `HTML` `CSS` & `JavaScript`. This is done to maintain compatablilty between hosting platforms and to reduce hosting cost. It also serves to keep the project simple and accessible; allowing me to focus my attention on the important matters.

As a result, without dynamic linking and automation, pages will be updated manually. This may cause mistakes to be missed. If you notice any, please try to inform me.

### Blogs

Blogs are contained in the `docs` folders as Word document as well as in the blogs folder for their web version. This is to allow me to draft posts before converting them to HTML and to provide a print version. Further, for any accessiblity needs not met by the website (i.e. Justified text may be hard to read for some) then users will be able to download the word document and tailor it to their needs.

### Research

Research is contained in the `DevBlog - Research` folder using an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/) and serves as a reference for my use (instead of keeping 30 Chrome tabs open). It will not be maintained for public usablitly but will remain open for viewing.
