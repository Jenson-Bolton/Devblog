# Research Question
Can existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data be used to procedurally model building interiors?

# Key Claims


# Method


# Results


# Limitations


# My Thoughts
 - For city building this can be used to realistically estimate population capacity of a building.
 - For real-life city-based game environments, interiors can be procedurally created saving time.
