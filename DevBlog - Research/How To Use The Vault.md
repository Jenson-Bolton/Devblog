This vault exists to turn **practice (game development, experiments, devblogs)** into **formal, reusable research**.  
It is not a storage system. It is a _thinking pipeline_.

# Overview
 - Papers are inputs
 - Notes are processing
 - Writing is output
 - Folders represent stages of thinking
 If something is stuck it is unfinished.

# Folder Rules
## 00 Inbox
Holding area for unprocessed commitments.

Used for:
 - Papers yet to be read
 - Ideas captured quickly
 - Links, PDFs, references not yet touched

Notes only belong here if they have not been meaningfully engaged with. Inbox notes are promises not knowledge.

## 01 Sources
Contains processed external material.

A worthy source note earns its place if:
 - The paper has been read
 - Key claims are understood
 - Interpretation has been added

Source notes represent:
 - What the authors claim
 - How they support it
 - Why it matters to the work

Source notes are not summaries but bridges into the work.

## 02 Notes
Notes contain atomic ideas:
 - One idea per note
 - Usable outside the context of a single paper

Atomic Notes:
 - Always link back to their source(s)
 - Often link to other atomic notes
 - Never contain multiple ideas

This is where papers are "digested". If a paper produces no atomic notes, it was not really read.

## 03 Concepts
Concept notes are syntheses.

They emerge when:
 - Multiple atomic notes point to the same idea
 - A stable understanding begins forming

A concept note:
 - Aggregates evidence
 - Holds tension and disagreement
 - Evolves over time

Concepts are where research identity forms,

## 04 Writing
Contains arguments, not notes.

Used for:
 - Devblog drafts
 - Academic drafts
 - Research statements

Writings:
 - Pull from concepts
 - Cite sources
 - Assemble ideas that already exist

If writing feels hard, the problem is upstream.

## 05 Daily Notes
Contains rough overview of a days work.

Used for:
 - Simple one sentence log
 - Track what was done when

Not used for:
 - Writing essays
 - Writing blogs
 - Writing atomic notes

Daily Notes track what was worked on to show improvement and recap where to pick up work. They are intentionally rough.

## 99 Archive
Contains inactive source material.

Archive:
 - Source notes that are no longer actively referenced
 - Old drafts that will not be revised

Do not archive:
 - Atomic notes
 - Concept notes

Ideas do not expire, sources do.

# Lifecycle of a paper
Papers have a clear path through the vault:
 - Enters the inbox as an intention to read
 - After reading, it becomes a source note
 - Its ideas are extracted into atomic notes
 - Those ideas influence concept notes
 - The concepts are used in writing
 - The source notes may eventually be archived

Once a paper has been fully processed, it should never have to be reread.

# How to Read a Paper in This System
Read does not need to be passive.

Before reading:
 - Create a source note
 - Write why it is being read

While reading:
 - Identify claims, not details
 - Paraphrase instead of highlighting
 - Note methods, scope, and limitations

After reading:
 - Extract at least two atomic notes
 - Add personal interpretation
 - Link to projects or questions
 
 A paper is finished when its ideas can live independently.

# How Dev Work Fits Into This Vault
Game development is research material, not noise.

Treat:
 - Prototypes as experiments
 - Devblogs as method logs
 - Failures as data

This should create:
 - Source notes for external papers
 - Atomic notes for insights from development
 - Concept notes that merger practice and theory

This is how opinion becomes knowledge.

# Tags and Metadata
Tags are used only for status, never for meaning.

Examples:
 - `#unread`
 - `#draft`
 - `#review`

Do not tag topics. Topics are handled through links.

# Graph View (How to Use It Correctly)
The graph is diagnostic, not inspirational.

Use it to:
 - Find orphaned ideas.
 - Spot underdeveloped concepts
 - See which sources dominate thinking

Ignore the global graph for motivation. Use local graphs for analysis.
